SPMSM optimal sliding mode sensorless rotor speed controller based on EKF and recursive least square method applied to STM32
Under extreme environmental conditions of high temperature, high humidity, strong magnetic field or vibration, the measurement accuracy of sensors will decrease, which will lead to the controller accuracy decline or even control instability. In view of this, this paper designs a composite sensorless rotor speed control strategy integrating extended kalman filter (EKF), recursive least squares method, and optimal SM sensorless control for surface mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor (SPMSM), which is mainly composed of a signal estimation algorithm based on EKF, an online parameter identification algorithm based on recursive least square, an optimal SM control algorithm, and a performance cost function. Among them, the signal estimation algorithm based on EKF is adopted to estimate SPMSM signals in real-time, which avoids the problems of increased control cost, increased volume, mechanical instability and reduced control accuracy and reliability caused by sensors. Leveraging the discrepancy between motor rotor reference speed and estimation speed based on EKF, an optimal SM control algorithm is devised to dynamically adjust the motor rotor speed. To avoid the impact of parameter disturbances on controller performance, an online parameter identification algorithm based on recursive least square is proposed to identify SPMSM parameters and update them in real-time into the designed optimal SM sensorless rotor speed controller. Finally, simulation and experimental test results from three typical cases, namely start-up response, speed mutation response, and load mutation response, prove that the feasibility, effectiveness, and robustness of the designed controller.
